Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a
    scientific workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the
    management of model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The
    goal of PECAn is to streamline the interaction between data and
    models, and to improve the efficacy of scientific investigation. The
    PEcAn.photosynthesis package contains functions used in the
    Hierarchical Bayesian calibration of the Farquhar et al 1980 model.
