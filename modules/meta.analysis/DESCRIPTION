Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a
    scientific workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the
    management of model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The
    goal of PECAn is to streamline the interaction between data and
    models, and to improve the efficacy of scientific investigation. The
    PEcAn.MA package contains the functions used in the Bayesian
    meta-analysis of trait data.
