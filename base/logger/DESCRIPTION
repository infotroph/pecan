Description: Convenience functions for logging outputs from 'PEcAn', the
    Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (LeBauer et al. 2017)
    <doi:10.1890/12-0137.1>. Enables the user to set what level of
    messages are printed, as well as whether these messages are written to
    the console, a file, or both. It also allows control over whether
    severe errors should stop execution of the 'PEcAn' workflow; this
    allows strictness when debugging and lenience when running large
    batches of simulations that should not be terminated by errors in
    individual models. It is loosely based on the 'log4j' package.
