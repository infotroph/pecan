Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a
    scientific workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the
    management of model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The
    goal of PECAn is to streamline the interaction between data and
    models, and to improve the efficacy of scientific investigation.  This
    module is used to create more complex visualizations from the data
    generated by PEcAn code, specifically the models.
